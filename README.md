# Rumination on Cognition

**Tel Aviv University, MSc Research Project (Jan 2023 â€“ June 2024)**

This repository provides all code, experimental materials, and analysis scripts used to investigate the effects of rumination on working memory and effort perception. It includes the full implementation of the experimental tasks, data collection tools, and statistical analysis pipelines.

- **/data/**:  dataset (de-identified)
- **/analysis code/**: R scripts for statistical analysis and figure generation

## Overview

Rumination, common in psychiatric disorders, may impair cognitive performance by interfering with task execution. This project tested whether an induced ruminative state impairs working memory and increases perceived effort due to cognitive interference.

## Methods

- **Rumination Induction:** Participants underwent a validated rumination or neutral control induction.
- **Working Memory Task:** An n-back task assessed working memory, with self-reported effort and concentration interference measured before and after induction.

## Key Findings

- Rumination impaired working memory and increased perceived cognitive effort, regardless of cognitive load, trait rumination, or depression severity.
- Performance deficits were mediated by cognitive interference; effort perception was not, suggesting distinct mechanisms.
- Exploratory analyses indicated rumination may specifically impair inhibitory control (increased false alarms).

## Skills & Tools

- Project development, pre-registration, and online data collection
- Task and induction design in JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Statistical analysis in R
